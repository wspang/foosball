# foosball
app that uses force sensors to auto track foosball statistics and upload to GCP Cloud SQL. 
from there, cool analytics can be performed and linked to dashboards to prove who is the #1 player.

better yet, host updates as APIs on APP Engine. Will also hold a stats
leaderboard page and other stuff.

Loading game logs in will be via local script and use API to upload stats.
